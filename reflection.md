# Major Project Reflections

## Description
For our project we attempted to make a small-scale pokemon game in which a player can move around, interact with building and people, and battle pokemon.

## How Much Need To Have Was Finished
- All of our need to haves were implemented but we weren't able to get the battle mechanics to function perfectly so it's not actually in the game
- Didn't find the time to finish actually buying items

## Biggest Challenge
- Code-wise the biggest challenge was getting the player/map movement perfect, since I wanted to get it similar to authentic pokemon games and it resulted in lots of bugs
- Though the biggest challenge overall for me was time
- Before the break I was able to make good use of my time, got basically all the parts requiring actual logic done
- I then lost 3 weeks due to vacation where I didn't find much time to begin with but when I did it wasn't an environment where I could effectively get work done, I also had assignments from other classes which didn't help.

## How Was It Solved
- I had some friends beta-test to find a bunch of small bugs
- Fixing the bugs took some time but for the most part it wasn't hard after I started thinking of the player's movement on a 2D grid (since that's how it moved), as opposed to a freely moving object.
- The time issues aren't something you can fix (sadly I don't have a time machine)

## What Would I Change if I Were to Redo
- Plan more ahead of time
- Add music
- Better efficiency
- More sprites
- Use more parameters and return functions

## Biggest Challenge
- Biggest challenge for me was coding the battle mechanics. I was able to get the looks of the simulator done but encountered some difficulties with the battle mechanics
- Some bugs were present when switching from the battle buttons
- Time was another issue for me. Was able to work well and got most things done before the break. During and after the break, I spent most time with scolarships and other classes. 

## How It Was Solved
- Last few days were spent mostly trying to figure out the battle mechanics. Some of the logic was done correctly but we couldn't really get it to work
- Some bugs were easily fixed while others took some time

## What would I Change If I Were To Redo
- improve layout of battle screen
- plan and work more ahead of time
- make some parts of code more efficient
- more pokemon
