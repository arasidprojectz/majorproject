# Major Project Reflections

## Description
For our project we attempted to make a small-scale pokemon game in which a player can move around, interact with building and people, and battle pokemon.

## Biggest Challenge
-Code-wise the biggest challenge was getting the player/map movement perfect, since I wanted to get it similar to authentic pokemon games and it resulted in lots of bugs
-Though the biggest challenge overall for me was time
-Before the break I was able to make good use of my time, got basically all the parts requiring actual logic done
-I then lost 3 weeks due to vacation where I didn't find much time to begin with but when I did it wasn't an environment where I could effectively get work done, I also had assignments from other classes which didn't help.

## How Was It Solved
-I had some friends beta-test to find a bunch of small bugs
-Fixing the bugs took some time but for the most part it wasn't hard after I started thinking of the player's movement on a 2D grid (since that's how it moved), as opposed to a freely flowing object.
-The time issues aren't something you can fix (sadly I don't have a time machine)

## What Would I Change If I Were to Redo
-Plan more ahead of time
-Add music
-Better efficiency
-More sprites
-Use more parameters and return functions
