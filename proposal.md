# Major Project Proposal

## Description
Our goal is to create a top-down RPG similar to Pokemon but on a much smaller scale. There will be a movable character with which the player will travel from city to city battling, catching, and leveling up to eventually achieve the game's main goal which will likely be to defeat the game's strongest NPC.

## Need To Have:
- A movable character
- NPCs
- Character dialog/interactions
- Battling/characters and attacks to battle with
- Battle system (hitpoints/damage calculation)
- AI system for battling
- Catching/battling wild Pokemons
- A goal for the player to pursue
- Different maps/ability to view maps
- Level system for Pokemon
- Different cities 
- Ability to enter buildings/interact with the environment
- Item system - different items will have different effects on Pokemon (ex. healing items)
- Pokemon center (place where you can heal your pokemon)/Pokemon shop where you can buy items
- Currency
- Pokemon types (with advantages/disadvantages)
- Menu system displaying Pokemon, Items, Save(nice to have), Trainer Card(holds information such as time spent playing, player name, currency), Pokedex(nice to have), Options, Return to Main Menu

## Nice To Have:
- Variations in Sprites
- Pokemon Evolution
- Ability to catch more than a set amount of pokemons/also able to store pokemon in a box
- Pokemon league
- Able to save your progress
- Intro screen with multiple save files and instructions
- Pokedex (saves data of encountered pokemon)
- Music/sound effects
- Mini map (ability to toggle on/off)
- Walking animations
