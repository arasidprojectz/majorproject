# Major Project Proposal - Bromons

## Description
Our goal is to create a top-down RPG similar to Pokemon but on a much smaller scale. There will be a movable character with which the player will travel from city to city battling, catching, and leveling up to eventually achieve the game's main goal which will likely be to defeat the game's strongest NPC.

## Need To Have:
- A movable character
- NPCs
- Character dialog/interactions
- Pokemon sprites
- Battling(with hitpoints/damage calculation)/character and attacks to battle with
- AI system for battling
- Catching(nice to have)/battling wild Pokemons
- A goal for the player to pursue
- Ability to enter buildings/interact with the environment
- Item system - different items will have different effects on Pokemon (ex. healing items)
- Pokemon center (place where you can heal your pokemon)/Pokemon shop where you can buy items
- Currency
- Menu system displaying Pokemon(nice to have multiple), Items, Save (nice to have), Trainer Card (holds information such as time spent playing, player name, currency), Pokedex (nice to have), Return to Main Menu

## Nice To Have:
- Pokemon types (with advantages/disadvantages)
- Level system for Pokemons
- Different maps/ability to view maps
- Different cities
- Variations in Sprites
- Pokemon Evolution
- Ability to catch multiple pokemons/also able to store pokemon in a box
