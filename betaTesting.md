# Beta-Testing

## Irtisam
- The map movement is buggy as it doesn't move when coming up from the bottom
- Doesn't properly detect if player is in the middle (x-axis)
- Crashes when entering building
- Ended up on grass when exiting building
- Character dialog only shown for a frame
- Talking to people is still buggy

## Anu
- Battling still not finished
- Movement feels clunky, hold function would have been nice
- Game screen is quite small on some screens
- Add instructions

## Matthew
- A "How to Play" would be helpful
- Overall enjoyed the graphics, such as color coordination, as it is similar to the original
- Map Layouts are nice
